## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, happy to have you here!

As a DevOps and Software Engineer with 14+ years of experience, I am passionate about driving innovation in infrastructure and observability. Throughout my career, I have empowered companies to achieve their goals through my expertise in AWS, Kubernetes, cost-saving strategies like optimizing cloud resources, Python, real-time communication technologies, and more.

My primary focus is on building robust infrastructures and implementing effective DevOps practices that enhance observability and streamline development processes. I thrive on challenges and actively seek opportunities to collaborate with like-minded professionals in the dynamic tech landscape.

Currently pursuing a master's degree in Applied Computer Science, I enjoy tackling intricate puzzles and problems, further enhancing my analytical skills.
